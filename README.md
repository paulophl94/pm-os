[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**An AI-powered operating system for Product Managers.** Document generation, daily planning, meeting intelligence, stakeholder tracking, multi-perspective reviews — all configured for your specific product. Fork it, configure your context, start shipping better documents in 10 minutes. Works with Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI editors.

Built by a PM who uses this system every day to manage two product domains at a LATAM e-commerce platform. Open source. No coding required.

---

## Editor Compatibility

PM OS works with any AI editor that can load context files. Pick the one you use:

| Editor | How PM OS loads | Experience |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)** | Auto-loads `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files | Full — rules, skills, and MCP integrations work natively |
| **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** | Reads `CLAUDE.md` as workspace instructions | Full — all workflows available via natural language commands |
| **Other AI editors** | Configure your editor to load `CLAUDE.md` as context | Full — same commands work wherever the context is loaded |

---

## See It In Action

**Without PM OS** — generic AI output:
```
User: "Create a PRD for subscription pause"
AI:   [Generic 2-page document with no product context, wrong terminology,
       misaligned metrics, no connection to company strategy]
```

**With PM OS** — context-aware, strategy-aligned output:
```
User: "Create a PRD for subscription pause"
AI:   [Reads your product vision, KPIs, terminology, and architecture]
      [Generates 15-section PRD aligned with your quarter goals]
      [Uses correct domain terms, references your metrics targets]
      [Suggests multi-perspective review as next step]
```

See [`documents/_EXAMPLE-PRD.md`](documents/_EXAMPLE-PRD.md) for a full example of generated output.

See [`documents/_EXAMPLE-ONE-PAGER.md`](documents/_EXAMPLE-ONE-PAGER.md) for an example One-Pager.

---

## What Pain This Removes

| Problem | How PM OS Solves It |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Context scattered across 6-8 tools** | One workspace with persistent memory. The AI resumes where yesterday left off. |
| **30 min every morning reconstructing state** | Morning briefing pulls calendar, meetings, Jira, and commitments automatically. |
| **Forgotten promises destroy credibility** | Staleness detection flags commitments >3 days and tasks >5 days with no update. |
| **Documents lack strategic alignment** | Context Loading Protocol reads your vision, KPIs, and roadmap before generating anything. |
| **PRDs approved without stress-testing** | Multi-perspective review simulates Engineer, Executive, Researcher, Customer, and CS feedback. |
| **No system for compounding knowledge** | Daily and weekly reviews capture learnings. Each session makes the next one better. |
| **Generic AI output, no product depth** | Product context file teaches the AI your product, users, terminology, and constraints. |

---

## 3-Tier Setup

Start light, grow into the full system.

### Tier 1 — Rules Only (5 minutes)

Fork the repo, fill in `product-context.mdc` with your product details, and start generating documents.

**What you get:**
- 14 document templates (PRD, One-Pager, User Stories, RICE, Risk Analysis, Lean Canvas, Roadmap, Epic Plan, KPI-Revenue, Status Update, Personas, Positioning, User Journey, Feature Docs)
- 6 multi-perspective reviewers (Engineer, Executive, User Researcher, Data Analyst, Customer, Customer Success)
- 6 strategy frameworks (Rumelt, Gibson Biddle DHM, Devil's Advocate, Impact Estimation, SWOT, Presentation Best Practices)
- PM coaching (automatic next-step suggestions, career insights)

### Tier 2 — Personal OS (15 minutes)

Set up the planning system and daily workflows.

**What you add:**
- Morning briefing, daily review, weekly review skills
- Meeting notes processor with person page updates
- Meeting prep with automatic context loading (person pages, open commitments, talking points)
- Level Up feature (discover unused PM OS capabilities)
- Toolkit improvement capture and ranking
- Planning hierarchy: quarter goals -> week priorities -> daily tasks
- Commitment tracker with staleness detection
- Learnings capture (preferences and anti-patterns)

### Tier 3 — Full Integration (30 minutes)

Connect your tools via MCP servers for live data in briefings and workflows.

**What you add:**
- Jira/Linear integration for live initiative tracking
- Calendar integration for automated meeting prep
- Meeting transcription (Fireflies, Otter, etc.) for automated summaries
- Slack for async communication

**Recommended MCP servers:**

| Integration | MCP Server | Used By |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Jira/Linear** | [Atlassian MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-atlassian) or [Linear MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-linear) | Morning briefing, progress tracking |
| **Calendar** | [Google Calendar MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-google-calendar) or [Zapier MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-zapier) | Morning briefing (today's schedule) |
| **Meeting Notes** | [Fireflies MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-fireflies) or paste transcripts manually | Meeting notes skill |
| **Slack** | [Slack MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-slack) | Async communication |
| **Docs** | [Google Docs MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic/mcp-google-docs) | Export documents |

To install an MCP server: in Cursor go to **Settings > MCP > Add Server**; in Claude Code use the `claude mcp add` command. Each skill gracefully degrades if its MCP is unavailable — you can always paste data manually.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulophl94/pm-os.git
cd pm-os
```

Open the folder in your AI editor of choice ([Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), or another AI-enabled editor).

### 2. Run the onboarding

In your AI chat, type:

```
/start
```

This opens the **[Interactive Onboarding Guide](ONBOARDING.html)** in your browser and launches the setup wizard, which walks you through:
1. Product concept and positioning
2. Daily ritual preferences (briefing, reviews)
3. Tool integrations (Jira, Slack, Fireflies)
4. Initial stakeholder person pages
5. Quarter goals and week priorities

The onboarding guide covers everything — how Agent Mode works and how to talk to PM OS in natural language, with instructions for both Cursor and Claude Code.

Or edit `product-context.mdc` manually — replace the `<!-- TODO -->` markers with your product details.

### 3. Start generating

```
Create a PRD for [your feature]
```

The AI reads your product context, loads relevant strategy files, and generates a document aligned with your product's vision and constraints.

## How the Planning System Works

Everything connects — from strategic goals down to today's work:

```
%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%
flowchart TD
    quarterGoals[Quarter Goals] --> weekPriorities[Week Priorities]
    weekPriorities --> dailyPlan[Daily Plan / Today's Three]
    quarterGoals -.-> tasks[Tasks Backlog]
    weekPriorities -.-> tasks
    tasks --> dailyPlan
    dailyPlan --> dailyReview[Daily Review]
    dailyReview -.->|Tomorrow| dailyPlan
    dailyReview -.->|Friday| weeklyReview[Weekly Review]
    weeklyReview -.->|Next week| weekPriorities
```

**Quarter Goals** (3-5 outcomes over 3 months) -> **Week Priorities** (Top 3 this week) -> **Daily Plan** (Today's Three) -> **Daily Review** (what happened) -> **Weekly Review** (patterns, next week's priorities).

Work backwards from impact: *What would make you incredibly satisfied three months from now?*

---

## The System That Improves Itself

PM OS captures learnings and improves over time:

- **Daily reviews** capture what worked and what didn't -> stored in `learnings/`
- **Weekly reviews** synthesize patterns across meetings and decisions
- **Preferences** (communication style, meeting habits) accumulate automatically
- **Anti-patterns** (mistakes to avoid) get flagged before they repeat

Day 1: helpful but generic. Week 2: knows your preferences. Month 1: adapted to your work style.

## Origin Story

This toolkit was built over months of daily use as a Product Manager at a LATAM e-commerce platform. It started as a single `product-context.mdc` file and grew into a full operating system — one frustrated morning at a time.

The insight that changed everything: **the quality of AI output is 80% context and 20% model.** Most people spend all their effort choosing the right model and zero effort structuring their context. This toolkit is the structured context.

If you want the full story, check out the [AI-Augmented PM series on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulophl94/) — 9 posts covering the journey from "hammer" to "workshop."
