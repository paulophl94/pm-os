# Meeting Notes Processor

Process meeting transcripts and notes to extract actionable insights, decisions, and next steps.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you have:
- Transcriptions from meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
- Handwritten or typed meeting notes
- Audio transcripts from user interviews
- Notes from stakeholder conversations

## Trigger Commands

- "Process meeting notes"
- "Extract action items from this meeting"
- "Summarize meeting notes"
- "Create meeting follow-up"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Request Input

Ask for the meeting content if not provided:

Provide the transcript or meeting notes. Also share:
- Type of meeting (planning, review, 1:1, stakeholder, discovery)
- Key participants
- Meeting objective (if known)

### Step 2: Process Content

Extract and organize:

1. **Key Decisions Made** — What was decided, who decided, rationale
2. **Action Items** — Task, owner, deadline, priority
3. **Discussion Highlights** — Main topics, key perspectives, areas of agreement/disagreement
4. **Open Questions** — Questions raised but not answered
5. **Risks & Blockers** — Problems, dependencies, concerns

### Step 3: Generate Output

Create a structured document:

```markdown
# Meeting Summary: [Title/Topic]

| Metadata | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Date** | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| **Type** | [planning/review/discovery/stakeholder/1:1] |
| **Participants** | [Names] |
| **Duration** | [If known] |

---

## TL;DR

[2-3 sentences summarizing the meeting outcome]

---

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Owner | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| [Decision 1] | [Who decided] | [Why] |

---

## Action Items

| Task | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| [ ] [Task 1] | [Name] | [Date] | P1/P2/P3 |

---

## Discussion Summary

### Topic 1: [Name]
- [Key point]
- **Conclusion:** [What was concluded]

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] [Question needing follow-up]

---

## Risks & Blockers Identified

| Risk/Blocker | Impact | Owner | Mitigation |
|--------------|--------|-------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [Who] | [Action] |

---

## Next Steps

1. [Immediate next step]
2. [Follow-up meeting if needed]
3. [Documents to create]

---

*Processed: [YYYY-MM-DD]*
```

### Step 4: Update Person Pages

After processing, **automatically** update person pages for key participants:

1. Check if person page exists in `@context/people/`
2. If not found, create one using `@context/people/_TEMPLATE.md`
3. Update with: meeting entry, open items (what you owe them / they owe you)
4. Tell the user which pages were created or updated

### Step 5: Update Commitments Tracker

**Automatically** update `@to_do's/commitments.md`:
- Your action items -> "I owe (pending)"
- Others' action items -> "Others owe me (pending)"

### Step 6: Suggest Follow-ups

Based on meeting content, suggest:
- Documents that should be created (PRD, One-Pager, etc.)
- People who should be informed
- Meetings that should be scheduled

## Special Processing Rules

### For Discovery/Interview Meetings
- Extract user pain points, capture verbatim quotes, identify patterns

### For Planning Meetings
- Focus on commitments, extract sprint/quarter goals, identify dependencies

### For Stakeholder Meetings
- Capture feedback and concerns, note approval status, track alignment

### For 1:1 Meetings
- Respect privacy — ask before documenting, focus on actionable items

## File Naming

Save as: `documents/MEETING-[type]-[topic]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
