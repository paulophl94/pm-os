## Tips

### Be specific
```
Good: "Create PRD for one-click checkout on mobile"
Bad:  "Create PRD for checkout"
```

### Add relevant context
```
Good: "Create One-Pager for cancel flow considering that 30% of cancels
       are due to lack of pause option"
```

### Use reviews in sequence
```
1. Review as engineer   -> adjust complexity
2. Review as customer   -> validate value
3. Review as executive  -> confirm priority
```
